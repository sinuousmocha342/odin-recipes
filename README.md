This is my first attempt at building a very bare-bones HTML website.
I will be using things I've learned during the foundations portion of The Odin Project.

I learned how to do make webpages, linking webpages together, adding images, and much more,
which I will be demonstrating here. It won't look nice, since this is a purely HTML site, without any
styling. This will mark my first step toward Web Development.
